TENSORFLOW
-constant
-placeholder (runtime pe input de sakkte haai)
-variables
-it is python supported framework but made in c++
-made in 2015 by google brain team

tensorflow uses-
1.neural network
2.image classification
3.maths calculation
we can use it in classifictaion and regression both
dendrite >input
neuron >storage
axon->ek neuron se dusre neuron jo bhejega vo hai
a network of many neurons-->mind(can say)
no sql works on clustering which is nn
neuron-->neural that's why neural network
known as artificial neural network..((ANN))
node can be cpu or gpu or tppu etc.
input->attribute/features-->processing--->o/p

1.)how many layers mean i/p layer .........output is not a layer..any layer can any no of neuron..
2.)each hidden layer process using a mathe eqn(known as activation function)
3.)in input layer no o fneurons should be equal to no of attribute(jyada diye to?)
4.) we will decide that each neron in ip layer should be connected to each neuron in hidden layer or not..
5.)no rule to put any act funnc first
6.)4 type are enough activ func 
7.)If ann has more than 2 layers than it is knwon as deep nn
8.)cost func ->actual o/p se general o/p ka error compare  karega (formula in pdf)
9.)geoffrey hinton
10.i. sigmoid ii. threshhold iii..rectifier iv.. hyperbolic tangent
11.)generally neurons in hidden layer is average of input layer 12--->6
12.)weight -->actual no me multiply so that negligible change is done
13.)what will neural netwrk do as  o/p me koi error aai to wieghts ko change karega and is known as back propogation
14.)comapre kon karega(o/p ayega multiple predicted o/p aayega usme differnce kaun compare karega
15.)erro aaya usme differnce kaun nikalega
16. )to adjust weights a math eqn named"gradient descent"
17.)epoc -->no of times ann will run mean that much time wieghts are adjusted and whole processing is done
18.) batchsize is what size of data should be given at a time out of whole data
