ann>--modification-->cnn
tesnorflow->>modificatiion-->keras
keras  has opetion it can use combination of (numpy+theano) or tensorflow
cnn mostly us keras
**CNN VS ANN
->in cnn each hidden layer neuron should connect with all next neurons(compulsory)
->we need gpu in cnn(vey much neccessary) no need in ann
->forward propogation is input to output
->back prop se input ke attribut me thoda change karte hai
BEFORE DOING ANN WE NEED TO DOING ONE THING THAT MAKE TOGETHER CNN.
for object detection atleast 10000 images
